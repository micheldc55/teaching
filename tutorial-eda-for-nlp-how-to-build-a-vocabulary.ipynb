I like to think of NLP tasks as a <b>X-step process</b>. One of the most complicated aspects of dealing with text data is that you need to preprocess your data thoroughly <b>before</b> doing any statistics.\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px\">\n    This is because most of the statistics depend on character/word/sentence counts, and it's impossible to determine those accurately without removing possible problems like links, mentions and other invonveniences.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px\">\n    First and foremost, let's import some of the libraries we are going to be using during this process. Most of them are standard for this tasks, so it's god to get familiar with them!\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>\n    Imports\n</h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nimport re\n\nimport typing\nfrom collections.abc import Iterable\n\nimport gc\n\nfrom IPython import display","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-03T16:31:15.845519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-03T16:31:15.846071Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-03T16:31:17.029056Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-03T16:31:15.845935Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-03T16:31:17.027811Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>\n    Process overview\n    </h1>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"font-size: 16px\">\n    Below you can find the general guide of how to preprocess data on NLP tasks. I'm not including the \"reading\" of the data even though it's relevant, because it's not something that is specific to NLP tasks. So imagine the first \"real\" step or step zero is actually reading the data.\n</p>\n    \n<ol style=\"font-size: 14px\">\n  <li>First, <b>explore the data carefully</b>: to get an overview of what we might expect. Here we check if the data contains links, mentions, etc. We have to know what we are going to have to deal with. Remember we generally want to remove these special cases, as ML models cannot learn from single occurences and they will probably reduce model performance.</li>\n    <li><b>Then we start the preprocesing stage</b>: Once we know what elements we want to preprocess in our data, we want to remove those that may affect the performance of the model. This is where we start preprocessing each line of text. <b>Stopwords are also removed at this stage</b>.</li>\n  <li>Third, we <b>apply general statistics</b>. Once the text is clean, we want a general understanding of the behavior of our data. Here we might apply character counts, word counts and sentence counts. At this point, it may be interesting to check if the counts are different (on average) for the different values of the target variable.</li>\n  <li>Then, <b>building the vocabulary and word frequency</b>. We want to understand which are the most frequent and relevant words in our data. There is a comment on word clouds in this section that may be important to read!</li>\n  <li>We then <b>implement the \"out-of-vocabulary\" token (#OOV)</b>. This token represents words that don't have enough relevance in the text to be fed to the ML model. There are other tokens that may be interesting to include. For example, most people remove numbers and percentages, but I've found that changing them for the #PERCENT token can yield good results.</li>\n  <li>Finally, we <b>vectorize the data</b>. Strings are not consumable by ML models, so we need to convert our data to a vector that the model can understand. There are a lot of approaches for this task, here we will use Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF transformations.</li>\n</ol>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1500/1*e-alZf1lGPNGXW81v3JC_A.jpeg\" width=\"400px\" align=\"center\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>\n    Reading the data\n    </h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_base = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/train.csv')\ndf_base.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-03T16:31:17.031263Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-03T16:31:17.031632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-03T16:31:47.888078Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-03T16:31:17.031600Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-03T16:31:47.886817Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"execution_count":2,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"      id    target                                       comment_text  \\\n0  59848  0.000000  This is so cool.

Gulp as you would say    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nOpen your mind too and you'll see the harmless CD seller had an identical previous incident where (again) he had a pistin in his belt.  While the actual events will play out and yes, the cops could have overreacted, you have to acknowledge that thugs with guns breaking tbe law by intimidating law abiding citizens on a sidewalk are hardly a victim in the truest sense.  It takes two to Tango and if you're breaking tbe law already and have a gun on you the liklihood of a bad outcome is obvious.    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nWhat insults about money laundering? All I've ever said is that they aren't going to get TRUMP, on collusion. I always said they were gonna get Manafort. You think they are going to get Trump on money laundering? WTH?    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nwrote a politician about getting tough on crime the reply was about limited resources and about a future bill that in my mind is soft on weaker crimes and heavy on harder crimes, might sound good to him though ask victims when the law let's criminals have lite sentencing only to return with more crimes and loss of life is involved when in fact if the sentencing was tough enough might a life could have been saved, I regret believing in this politician and would give the name though legally I can't though maybe it's time Alaska have a new politician that is tough on crime instead of a smile on the face speaking a good talk though no real action that could and should put these criminals way for more than some sweet deal allowing them to serve limited time while the family of the victim spend life suffering. Get tough on crime is more than a slap on the wrist how about sentencing that doubles after first conviction for every conviction after than maybe crime will fall out of fear    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nWho's Kevin O'Leary?????    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nYou are correct, and the reasons for that have been thoroughly explored.  Now, can you address what sort of a job the GOP has done so far now that they have the majorities in all three branches of government?  Would really like to hear some of your thoughts on that, TomQuinn.  Thanks.    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nThe parallels to the middle east today are amazing.    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nThis guy seems to be a cross between Warden Samuel Norton in The Shawshank Redemption & Sheriff Arpaio.    | \"Not Toxic\"\n\nSlime? Democrats and terrorists are practically the same thing.(kill them all) then we'll have our peace and prosperity.    | \"Toxic\"\n\nIf I were a lawyer I'd likely commit suicide.\nNothing in Canada says \"fascism' so loudly, arrogantly and uncontrollably as Canada's unjust, undemocratic, hypocritical, elitist, medieval legal system.    | \"Toxic\"\n\nI'm for anything that gets rid of Texans...    | \"Toxic\"\n\nWhen you move into another groups, Indians, country....treat it with respect...These people will be tough to work with in the future....damn their parents...    | \"Toxic\"\n\nBTW, www.akima.com is open and ready for contact. I just sent them a “shame on you” email, if you feel the same, fire away!    | \"Toxic\"\n\nThat's pretty silly, isn't it?  Just so everyone's clear, what's your definition of \"address the issue?\"  Sort of hard to take your approach seriously when you don't offer a single, specific idea that would be more effective than government following the rules they should already be following (i.e., what would have stopped this killer from getting a firearm).    | \"Toxic\"\n\nThe only thing stunning about her loss was the MSM's attempt to not only promote her but to convince the American public that she was impeccable and the only candidate to vote for.   There's not a single Trump voter who fell for that crap or the rigged polls that tried to show she was winning.  So now she's on her \"World Blame Game Book Tour\"........Hey Europe, do us a favor, keep her over there.......    | \"Toxic\"\n\nMelania gave a great speech.  A great contrast to the garbage from many of the male speakers including the former NYC mayor.  The concern over Ms. Obama lines is a waste of time.  Neither woman wrote their speech.  Perhaps there was some overlap on the writer teams that did.  After all, throughout all our politics we are just listening to tried and true manipulative rhetoric stored in a special politician writers book.  Maybe, in fact, Melania's use of Obama's lines was a characteristic Trumpian refusal to do the \"correct\" thing.  That's what I like about Trump.  He has the audacity to refuse to be put in a box and behave the way he is supposed to.  I like those who rock the intellectual boat.    | \"Toxic\"\n\nIf you were white you'd be a Nazi KKK you're so racist and narrow minded.    | \"Toxic\"\n\n\"Throw\" the very poor, not \"through\" the very poor...\nThat mistake of mine does bring another point to mind, as I see her as she is now, as a very rich person. That does make her tough to relate to by the millions who traditionally vote Democratic, and her sucking up to the very corrupt bankers makes seeing her as a champion of we the lost and wandering poor kind of hard.\nSure, Kennedy was rich, but he was also a veteran. She doesn't get to the Presidency except through the votes of the very poor, and they need to find a way to see her as a champion. That part of her campaign isn't going so well. Whether she chops brush back like Reagan or Bush the older doesn't matter so much as how safe the poor will feel with her in office, and by that I mean safe from people like her damn husband. He is famous for saying, as the jobs got exported, that \"those jobs aren't coming  back\".
